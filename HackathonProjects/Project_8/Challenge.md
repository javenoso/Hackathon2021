## PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
The prevalence of misinformation has skyrocketed in today’s world of social media, affecting the decision-making process of the general population. Our objective is to develop a machine-learning (ML) based framework that can be used as a “misinformation predictor” if trained properly. We will also provide a detailed exposition into the performance metric of different ML-based techniques to improve the prediction confidence. Finally, we will present a set of concluding remarks that will enable the user to have better understanding of potential fake news even without an ML-based model, and prevent the transmission of misinformation. If developed properly, this framework can act as a primary filter embedded in social media sites and defend the general population against targeted misinformation. 

## DELIVERABLE: 

    1. Jupyter notebook: A complete pipeline demonstrating the application of ML-based framework as an information-classifier.

    2. Jupyter notebook: A comparative performance-analysis of different machine-learning techniques

    3. A web-page at Google sites: Summary and concluding remarks.

## SKILLS NEEDED: 

Python, Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow/Keras, etc.
